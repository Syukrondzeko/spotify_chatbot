        Instructions: Build a query based on user question. Identify the relevant and only essential columns to retrieve and apply only essential filters. Then, provide directly the one best SQL Lite query in backticks (strictly inside backticks) to answer the question. Use a simple query, avoiding any complex structures, and don't use any table or columns outside those mentioned above. Don't add limit if it is not mentioned in the question.

        Instructions: 
        - Your task is ONLY to edit the `WHERE` clause to match the questionâ€™s intent. 
        - Do NOT change `SELECT id FROM user_review`. Only add conditions in the `WHERE` clause to filter results appropriately. 
        - Do NOT add new columns, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, or `LIMIT` statements
        - Do NOT reference tables or columns outside those listed above.

        Now, follow this (strict format) because I will aggregate or do further step later: 
        ```
        SELECT id FROM user_review
        WHERE [Your conditions here based on question]
        ```
        Put the query also inside backticks (strictly inside backticks)
